                    <h2>You can fight your ticket in court and win!</h2>
                    <p>Although, in the 6<sup>th</sup> ward, only 10% of tickets get contested, those which do
                        win their in court cases 65% of the time.</p>

                    <h2>Important Deadlines</h2>
                    <!-- TODO maybe we can make this like a story/timeline? -->
                    <p>For a parking or compliance violation, you have 7 days from the date your ticket was
                        issued to contest it. If a contest or payment has not been made by then, you will be
                        given another 21 days to request a hearing.</p>
                    <p>For traffic law violations caught by an automated camera (red light or speeding
                        violations) you are given 21 days from the Notice of Violation to contest the ticket or a
                        Notice of Determination will be mailed to you detailing that you have been found liable.</p>
                    <p>However, you still have the option to petition to stop the default judgement by appearing in person
                        within 21 days after you have received the Notice of Determination.
                        After this you can no longer contest the ticket.</p>
                    <p>After 25 days of the Notice of Determination you will be mailed a Notice of Final
                        Determination detailing that you can no longer contest the ticket and a penalty equal to
                        the amount of the fine will be given.</p>

                    <h2>How to win your case in court</h2>
                    <p>For parking or compliance violations, including the most common violations in the 6th
                        ward (no city sticker, no standing/parking, street cleaning, expired plates, missing plates), the
                        following defenses could be used:</p>

                    <!-- TODO remove legalese but otherwise good -->
                    <!-- TODO link to original legal definitions? -->
                    <ul>
                        <li>You were not the owner of or were not leasing the vehicle at the time the ticket was issued</li>
                        <li>The vehicle or its plates were stolen when the ticket was issued</li>
                        <li>The signs prohibiting or restricting parking were missing or were too difficult to see</li>
                        <li>The parking meter was not functional and not because of anything you did</li>
                        <li>The alleged violations are not consistent with what was brought up during the
                            time the ticket was issued (e.g., You may contest a city sticker violation if you
                            have resided in Chicago for less than 30 days or you purchased the cited vehicle
                            in the last 30 days, tinted windows can be a required medical accessory when
                            complying with 5 ILCS 5/12-503(g); the residential parking permit was issued to a
                            delivery, service, or repair vehicle or home health care provider doing business
                            with or assisting a resident of the zone; etc.); </li>
                        <li>The illegal condition cited did not exist at the time the ticket was issued
                        <li>The compliance violation has been corrected prior to the judge making a ruling;
                            however, you must ensure you are not applicable to other compliance violations
                            at this time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Handling Debt</h2>
                    <p>Are you in unmanagable debt with the City of Chicago, due to being under unfair
                        pressure caused by receiving too many parking violations? </p>
                    <p>If yes, don't worry, thereâ€™s a pretty good chance that you can
                        appeal your violations to substantially reduce the amount owed.</p>

                    <h2>Has your car been towed as a result of late penalties?</h2>
                    <p>Filing for bankruptcy may help to ease your situation, since it allows you to keep possession of your vehicle.</p>
